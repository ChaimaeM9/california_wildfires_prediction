# california_wildfires_prediction
This is a machine learning project set out to predict wildfire size in California and hopefully prevent large fires  based on Weather elements 14 days before and after the start of the fire.
 using several tools: naive bayes, k nearest neighbors, pca, linear regression, and logisitic regression.
